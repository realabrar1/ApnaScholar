Before starting, you have to understand that writing a research paper requires you to demonstrate a strong knowledge of your topic and make an original contribution to the debate.<\/p><p><strong>Understanding the assignment<\/strong><\/p><p>Here\u2019s a simple step by step guide may help understand how to start your assignment to proofreading your final draft.<\/p><p>Before you start, you have to make sure that you thoroughly understand the assignment task sheet by reading it carefully or if you need to clarify anything with your professor. You should carefully consider your timeframe and should plan enough time to research, write and edit. You also need to identify the assignment goal, deadline, length specifications, formatting, and submission method.<\/p><p><strong>Picking a research paper topic<\/strong><\/p><p>With so many possibilities, there are many ways to generate an idea for a research paper, you only need to brainstorm a lot through with a fellow student or professor. One can surely try freewriting to identify anything relevant that could be interesting as well. You can also check the discussion or recommendations sections of research papers as it often includes ideas for other specific topics that require further examination.<\/p><p>Candidates who have completed admission tests such as the UGC NET, GATE, JEST, and others are regularly offered fellowships while completing a Ph.D. program. Furthermore, institutes such as IGNOU and Delhi University (DU) offer fellowships to Ph.D. students enrolling full-time. The Ph.D. degree is the pinnacle of academic achievement, opening the way for a successful career.<\/p><blockquote><div class=\"about-text\"><p><strong>A preliminary research<\/strong><\/p><p>For this, you need to use a variety of sources, including journals, books and websites that will help you ensure you do not miss anything important. Not just that, but, you also need to look for sources that may contradict your point of view.<\/p><p><strong>Develop a thesis statement<\/strong><\/p><p>You should also know that a thesis statement establishes the purpose and position of your paper. For example, if you started with a research question, the thesis statement should answer it. It should probably be concise, contentious, and coherent and should summarize the argument you made in a sentence or two.<\/p><\/div><\/blockquote><h3 class=\"h4 mt-40\"><strong>Outline of research paper<\/strong><\/h3><p>Before moving ahead, we really need to understand that a research paper outline is essentially a list of the key topics and evidence you want to include. You need to divide it into sections with headings so that you know roughly what the paper will look like. And most importantly, a structured outline can help make the writing process much more efficient.<\/p><p><strong>Structuring the paragraph<\/strong><\/p><p>The basic building blocks of research papers are paragraphs and therefore it should focus on a single claim that will help you to establish the overall purpose of the paper.<\/p><p><strong>First draft<\/strong><\/p><p>You should know that most probably your first draft won\u2019t be perfect, but making one is important. You can polish it later on. You definitely do not need to start by writing the introduction. In fact, begin where it feels most natural for you. While writing your first draft, if you dislike something you have written or doesn\u2019t quite fit, move it to a different document, just do not delete it completely as it might be useful later.<\/p><p><strong>Research paper introduction<\/strong><\/p><p>The introduction should address three important questions \u2014 what, why, and how? As the reader should know what the paper is about and why it is worth reading.<\/p><p><strong>Research paper conclusion<\/strong><\/p><p>For the conclusion, you have to trace the course of the paper and emphasize how it all comes together to prove your thesis statement. Then, you need to give the paper a sense of finality by making sure the reader understands what you have written.<\/p><p><strong>Revision<\/strong><\/p><p>This is one of the most important steps as revision and proofreading process will ensure the paper is as well-articulated as possible.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A research paper is longer and more detailed assignments and is designed to assess your writing skills as well as skills in scholarly research.
