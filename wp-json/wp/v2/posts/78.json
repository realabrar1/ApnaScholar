No matter how good your writing skills are- you cannot write anything great the first time. Few people have a misconception that editing is correcting grammar &amp; spelling errors. But, it\u2019s much more than that. Sometimes, if you would check your content after a day, you wouldn\u2019t even believe that you wrote that senseless content.

Read your content properly line by line. Read some part, take a break for some time &amp; then edit it again. It is tiresome but you must do it to achieve degree &amp; success. A good time to start editing is when you get writer\u2019s block; read over some content to edit, and get re-inspired.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Be your critic:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>While you are editing the content, read it as you are checking someone else\u2019s content. Though it\u2019s somewhat difficult to point out your own mistakes but try to be your best critic. Also, try to take help of your friends, someone who has knowledge in your field. Their honest feedback will help you a lot.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t edit the entire content at once:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Take out 2 days for 1 chapter. Divide that chapter into sections. Once you\u2019ve edited the chapter, take some break. It will help you to concentrate better on the content. While editing, pressure is already too much. In such case, following the above given advice would help you to do it in a gradual manner.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Proofread your content:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Once you feel that you\u2019ve edited the content &amp; have done the required changes, proceed to the proofreading part. Correcting the grammar, spelling errors is a part of proofreading. It seems like a small task but its role is very important. Even if you\u2019ve done a lot of research, having too many grammatical mistakes ruin your content &amp; hard work.
